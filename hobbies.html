            Coding
            <dd>
                I started trying to code back in 2018. What inspired me to start coding was video games. I've always wanted to create my own video games, and I started on a website called ROBLOX. Of course, having no one to teach me, I was horrible at it. Not only that, but I was also extremely young back then, being onlynine years old. Throughout the years though, I've gotten a lot better, and thanks to this class, I feel like I've learned faster than I ever have.

            Game Creation
            <dd>
                As stated above, I've always wanted to create my own video games. It started from when I played ROBLOX for the first time on my brother's account. It seemed so interesting to me how people could just create, really, anything they wanted. As time went on, I became more interested in how stories could be told in these games, and that soldified my love for games even more. Below are some images of a game I made for a friend's birthday.
